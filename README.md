## Reflection

After exploring the topic of Skills and Interests, I realized how important it is for career satisfaction to align one's job with personal values and strengths. Many people find themselves in roles that don’t reflect who they are, which can lead to burnout and a lack of motivation. This encouraged me to reflect on whether my own career path truly aligns with what matters to me.

Through this module, I was able to identify the kinds of tasks and environments that energize and fulfill me—not just the ones I’m capable of doing. I discovered that my core values include creativity, independence, and helping others. These values suggest that I’m drawn to work that falls under Artistic, Social, and Enterprising interest areas.

By completing the skills self-assessment, I identified key transferable and adaptive skills such as problem-solving, communication, and leadership. This has given me a clearer understanding of the work environments and roles where I can thrive. I now recognize that by aligning my interests and values with my career path, I can build a future that is not only achievable but also personally rewarding.

# Personality Assessment

## Evidence

Personality Assessment Results (RIASEC):

Realistic
Investigate
Conventional

## Reflection:
Through this module, I realized how personality traits play a major role in both career satisfaction and team performance. One key insight I gained is that a mismatch between personality and work environment can affect productivity and morale. This became clear to me during a group project, where I noticed that although I shared valuable input, I occasionally had friction with teammates about how tasks should be carried out.

Using the structured personality assessment tools provided in the module, I identified my dominant RIASEC types as Realistic, Investigative, and Conventional. This confirmed that I work best in structured environments where I can engage with practical tasks, solve problems, and follow clear systems. It also highlighted that while I enjoy leading and analyzing tasks, I need to be more mindful of how I communicate my ideas.

As a result, I began adjusting my communication approach by listening more actively and being open to others' methods. This shift greatly improved my contribution to group work and enhanced overall collaboration. Understanding my personality not only helped with teamwork—it also gave me a clearer sense of the roles and environments that suit me best in the IT field.

# Create a CV

## Evidence:
![Create a CV](<Create a CV-1.PNG>)

Before this module, I hadn’t fully realized how important a well-crafted CV is in making a strong first impression. I learned that many candidates are overlooked not because they lack the right skills, but because their CVs fail to clearly communicate their strengths and potential. This made me reflect on how my own CV might not have been showcasing my value effectively.

As part of this module, I took steps to improve my CV by focusing on structure, clarity, and relevance. I approached it as a marketing document—something that should not just list my qualifications but highlight how I align with what employers are looking for. I made sure to organize each section logically and include a personal profile, clearly defined skills, and action-oriented descriptions of my experience.

The work-readiness training helped me understand how to present my qualifications and personal strengths in a way that is concise, professional, and targeted. I now feel more confident that my CV reflects both who I am and what I have to offer. This experience has also improved my attention to detail and helped me better understand what employers value in a candidate.

# CV Submission

## Evidence

## Reflection:

I learned that even a strong CV can be ignored if it’s submitted poorly. Formatting errors, unclear emails, or bad timing can hurt your chances. My task was to submit my CV professionally, ensuring it reflected my skills and was sent with proper email etiquette. By following the module’s guidance on communication, I improved how I present myself to employers and feel more confident in future applications.

Conclusion
This portfolio showcases the personal and practical growth I’ve gained through the Work-Readiness Module. From setting clear career goals and identifying my strengths, to building a professional CV and learning how to communicate effectively, I now feel more confident and prepared for the modern workplace. The module has equipped me with both the mindset and tools to approach the job market with clarity and purpo
