# Seymour Lawrence: GitHub Digital-Portfolio

Welcome to my Work-Readiness Digital Portfolio. This portfolio showcases my development through the FID Standard Work-Readiness Module, highlighting five essential areas which is Career Counselling, Skills and Interests, Personality Assessment, CV Creation, and CV Submission. Each section includes evidence of learning and reflection using the STAR technique to demonstrate how my knowledge and workplace readiness have progressed throughout this course.
